```

Criteria for project:

1) No code is used repetitively (no more than twice) [10 points]

2) More than one variant of purrr::map is used [10 points]

3) At least one {purrr} function outside the basic map family (walk_*, reduce, modify_*, etc.) [10 points]

4) At least one instance of parallel iteration (e.g., map2_*, pmap_*) [10 points]

5) At least one use case of purrr::nest %>% mutate() [10 points]

6) At least two custom functions [20 points; 10 points each].
Each function must do exactly one thing. 
The functions may replicate the behavior of a base function - as noted above this is about practicing the skills you learn in class. 

7) Code is fully reproducible and housed on GitHub [10 points]

8) No obvious errors in chosen output format [10 points]

9) Deployed on the web and shareable through a link [10 points]
